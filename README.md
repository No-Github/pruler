# Introduction

Ruler is a tool that allows you to interact with Exchange servers remotely, through either the MAPI/HTTP or RPC/HTTP protocol. The main aim is abuse the client-side Outlook features and gain a shell remotely.

The full low-down on how Ruler was implemented and some background regarding MAPI can be found in our blog posts:
* [Ruler release]
* [Pass the Hash with Ruler]
* [Outlook forms and shells]
* [Outlook Home Page – Another Ruler Vector]

For a demo of it in action: [Ruler on YouTube]

## What does it do?

Ruler has multiple functions and more are planned. These include

* Enumerate valid users
* Create new malicious mail rules
* Dump the Global Address List (GAL)
* VBScript execution through forms
* VBScript execution through the Outlook Home Page

Ruler attempts to be semi-smart when it comes to interacting with Exchange and uses the Autodiscover service (just as your Outlook client would) to discover the relevant information.

# Getting Started

Compiled binaries for Linux, OSX and Windows are available. Find these in [Releases]
information about setting up Ruler from source is found in the [getting-started guide].

# Usage

Ruler has multiple functions, these have their own documentation that can be found in the [wiki]:

* [BruteForce] -- discover valid user accounts
* [Rules] -- perform the traditional, rule based attack
* [Forms] -- execute VBScript through forms
* [Homepage] -- use the Outlook 'home page' for shell and persistence
* [GAL] -- grab the Global Address List

# Attacking Exchange

The library included with Ruler allows for the creation of custom message using MAPI. This along with the Exchange documentation is a great starting point for new research. For an example of using this library in another project, see [SensePost Liniaal].
